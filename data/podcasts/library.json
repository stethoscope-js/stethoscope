    "description": "In this podcast — whose profits go to charities helping those affected by Coronavirus — Emily V. Gordon and Kumail Nanjiani are uniquely qualified to lead you through this forced quarantine situation. They are both writers who work from home. Emily was a therapist and currently is a chronically sick person (see: The Big Sick) who often has to quarantine herself, and Kumail is her main caretaker. Plus, we both just like being at home. Let us advise you on how to stay calm and avoid cabin fever. Let us give you entertainment recommendations. Let us give you constant updates on the squirrel vs. bird war happening right outside our window. Let us not talk about the C word at all. And most of all, let us take all of the proceeds from this podcast and spread it amongst charities that are helping those who are hit hardest by this quarantine. \n\n\n100% of the Net Revenue* from the podcast will be donated in equal portions to the following charities to support their efforts to assist those affected by the COVID-19 pandemic: \nhttps://www.restaurantworkerscf.org/\nhttps://disasterphilanthropy.org/\nhttps://www.feedingamerica.org/\n\n*\"Net Revenue” is defined as the “Advertising Gross Revenue” received by Hyperobject Podcast and Three Uncanny Four less agency fees and actual costs incurred to produce, distribute, and promote the Podcast.  “Advertising Gross Revenue” is calculated by the (cost per thousand) rate times the total impressions delivered.",
