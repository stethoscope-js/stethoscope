In each episode, one of the two becomes a human guinea pig as she tries to solve a specific work-related problem. Using the advice of so-called productivity experts, the duo tackles obstacles like ineffective to-do lists, overflowing inboxes and unruly meetings. Self-improvement is, by some estimates, a $10 billion sector, but can any of the productivity hacks these experts preach actually improve Francesca and Rebecca's work lives? Follow along with their attempts, insights and missteps, and maybe find a solution that will work for you.",
