    "description": "Hosts Francesca Levy and Rebecca Greenfield navigate the productivity industry by way of their own experiences. In each episode, one of the two becomes a human guinea pig as she tries to solve a specific work-related problem. Using the advice of so-called productivity experts, the duo tackles obstacles like ineffective to-do lists, overflowing inboxes and unruly meetings. Self-improvement is, by some estimates, a $10 billion sector, but can any of the productivity hacks these experts preach actually improve Francesca and Rebecca's work lives? Follow along with their attempts, insights and missteps, and maybe find a solution that will work for you.",

Gordon and Kumail Nanjiani are uniquely qualified to lead you through this forced quarantine situation. They are both writers who work from home. Emily was a therapist and currently is a chronically sick person (see: The Big Sick) who often has to quarantine herself, and Kumail is her main caretaker. Plus, we both just like being at home. Let us advise you on how to stay calm and avoid cabin fever. Let us give you entertainment recommendations. Let us give you constant updates on the squirrel vs. bird war happening right outside our window. Let us not talk about the C word at all.
